# Streamlit Model Development and Testing App

This repository contains a Streamlit application designed for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), visualizing Machine Learning (ML) insights, and testing ML models with provided datasets.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
git clone https://github.com/MichaelBurnes/streamlit_test

#### Running the Application
To run the Streamlit app, use the following command:
    streamlit run app.py
The app will be served at http://localhost:8501 by default. Open this address in your web browser to interact with the application.

#### Testing the Model
As part of the model development process, we will provide a test dataset during our conversation. This dataset can be used to test the integrity and performance of the ML model integrated into the Streamlit app.

To test the model with the provided dataset:
    Ensure the dataset is in the correct format as expected by the model (e.g., CSV, JSON).
    Navigate to the 'Test Model' page within the Streamlit app.
    Upload the dataset using the provided interface.
    The app will process the dataset and display the model's predictions and performance metrics.
